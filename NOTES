What's new in Rails 3.1, and why it matters

Rails 3.1...

 * is opinionated (as always!)
 * gets little stuff right
 * plays better with Rack

Getting Rails 3.1

     rvm 1.9.2@railspre --create
     gem install rails --pre
     rails new todo
     cd todo
     bundle
     rails g scaffold project name:string
     rake db:migrate
     rake test

What's new

 * asset management
 * jquery-ujs
 * HTTP Streaming
 * reversible migrations
   **  To use reversible migrations, mjust define the "change" method
   **  Migrations should use instance methods rather than class methods
